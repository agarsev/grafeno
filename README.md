Grafeno
=======

Python library for concept graph extraction from text, operation, and
linearization. An integrated web service is provided.

This library is still a work in progress, but it has shown to be already useful
for a number of applications, for example extractive text summarization.

Install
-------

Using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/):

1. `poetry install`
2. If you want to install some extras, run `poetry install --extras "web lexical
   modules"` with the extras that you need (see `pyproject.toml`).
3. `poetry run setup`

To run any grafeno script with poetry, use `poetry run` before the name of the
script and its arguments.

Documentation
-------------
The documentation is a work in progress, so it is a bit patchy, but go ahead and
read it in [ReadTheDocs](http://grafeno.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Examples
--------
See the notebooks in the [examples directory](docs/_examples) for how to use grafeno
in different applications.

Web Service
-----------
Run the `server.py` script to get a json web service which exposes most of the
pipeline functionality.

Use `-h` to get the list of options available.

Test script
-----------
A test script is provided in `test.py` that can run a pipeline to test the
library. It can serve as the entry point to the library operation, or as an
example of how to use it from python.

Use `-h` to get the list of options available.

Requirements
------------
- [python](https://www.python.org/) >= 3.4
    - Python packages for use of the library are listed in `requirements.txt`.
      We recommend using [conda](https://conda.io/docs/) to install grafeno and
      its dependencies in a virtual environment.
- A dependency parser. For now, the following are supported:
    - [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) (recommended)
    - [freeling](http://nlp.lsi.upc.edu/freeling/node/1)
- If using the `simplenlg` linearizer, a `java` executable will have to be
  available.

You may also need some NLTK data, for example 'wordnet' and 'wordnet_ic'. They
can be downloaded in python with:
```python
import nltk
nltk.download(['wordnet', 'wordnet_ic'])
```
